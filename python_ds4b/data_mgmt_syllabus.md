# Data Management

You’ll learn how to get data, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. In this course, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. You’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing and exploring data. This is a three-credit hour course.
