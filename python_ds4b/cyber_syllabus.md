# Cyber Secuirty for Business Professionals

This hands-on course will provide students demos and lessons on Python basics and walkthrough labs portraying the usefulness Python has in a variety of information security areas. Students will have guided instruction and walk through programming in Python. Each lab builds upon the next allowing for guided instruction. 

Students will learn:

1. **Digital Forensics**: Collects, processes, preserves, analyzes and presents computer-related evidence in support of network vulnerability mitigation and/or criminal, fraud, counterintelligence, or law enforcement investigations.
1. **Exploitation Analysis**: Analyze collected information to identify vulnerabilities and potential for exploitation.
1. **Software Development**: Develops and writes/codes new (or modifies existing) computer applications, software, or specialized utility programs following software assurance best practices.
1. **Systems Analysis**: Studies an organization's current computer systems and procedures, and designs information systems solutions to help the organization operate more securely, efficiently, and effectively. Brings business and information technology (IT) together by understanding the needs and limitations of both.
1. **Vulnerability Assessment and Management**: Conducts assessments of threats and vulnerabilities; determines deviations from acceptable configurations, enterprise or local policy; assesses the level of risk; develops and/or recommends appropriate mitigation countermeasures in operational and nonoperational situations.
