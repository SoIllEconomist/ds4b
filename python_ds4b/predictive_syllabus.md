# Predictive Analytics
This course aims to go beyond the classical statistical methods. As computing power has increased many new, highly computational, regression, or “Machine Learning”, methods have been developed. There has been a significant expansion of the number of possible approaches. Since these methods are so new, the business community is generally unaware of their huge potential. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, machine learning has become a hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance and other business disciplines. People with machine learning skills are in high demand.
