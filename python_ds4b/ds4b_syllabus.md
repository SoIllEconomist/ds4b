# Data Science for Business

You’ll learn how to get data, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. In this course, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. You’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing and exploring data. 

Furthermore, This course aims to go beyond the classical statistical methods. As computing power has increased many new, highly computational, regression, or “Machine Learning”, methods have been developed. There has been a significant expansion of the number of possible approaches. Since these methods are so new, the business community is generally unaware of their huge potential. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, machine learning has become a hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance and other business disciplines. People with machine learning skills are in high demand.

This is a three-credit hour course.
