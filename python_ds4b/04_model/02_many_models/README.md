# Many models
## Introduction

In this chapter you’re going to learn three powerful ideas that help you to work with large numbers of models with ease:

1. Using many simple models to better understand complex datasets.
1. ing list-columns to store arbitrary data structures in a data frame. For example, this will allow you to have a column that contains linear models.
1. Using the `pandas` to turn models into tidy data. This is a powerful technique for working with large numbers of models because once you have tidy data, you can apply all of the techniques that you’ve learned about earlier in the book.

We’ll start by diving into a motivating example using data about life expectancy around the world. It’s a small dataset but it illustrates how important modelling can be for improving your visualisations. We’ll use a large number of simple models to partition out some of the strongest signals so we can see the subtler signals that remain. We’ll also see how model summaries can help us pick out outliers and unusual trends.

The following sections will dive into more detail about the individual techniques:

This chapter is somewhat aspirational: if this book is your first introduction to Python, this chapter is likely to be a struggle. It requires you have to deeply internalised ideas about modelling, data structures, and iteration. So don’t worry if you don’t get it — just put this chapter aside for a few months, and come back when you want to stretch your brain.
