# WHAT IS EXPECTED OF YOU
## Graduate Student Edition
(Adapted from "Teaching at the University Level" by Stephen Zucker, Notices Amer. Math. Soc. 43 (1996), p. 863)

1. You are no longer undergraduate. The vast majority of you, not having done so already, will have to discard undergraduate notions of teaching and learning and replace them by graduate-level assumptions. This may be difficult, but it must happen sooner or later, so sooner is better. Our goal is more than just getting you to reproduce what was told you in the classroom.
2. Expect to have material covered at two to three time the pace of undergrad. Above that, we aim for more excellent command of the content, especially the ability to apply what you have learned to new situations (when relevant).
3. Lecture time is at a premium, so it must be used efficiently. You cannot be "taught" everything in the classroom. It is YOUR responsibility to learn the material. Most of this learning must take place outside the classroom. You should be willing to put in two to four hours outside the classroom for each hour of class.
4. The instructor's job is primarily to provide a framework, with some of the particulars, to guide you in doing your learning of the concepts and methods that comprise the material of the course. It is not to "program" you with isolated facts and problem types nor to monitor your progress.
5. You are expected to read the textbook for comprehension. It gives a detailed account of the material of the course. It also contains many examples of problems worked out, and these should be used to supplement those you see in the lecture. The textbook is not a novel, so the reading must often be slow-going and careful. However, there is a definite advantage that you can read it at your own pace. Use pencil and paper to work through the material and to fill in omitted steps.
6. Do not expect that exam problems are precisely the same as in homework problems. Homework problems should be understood to strengthen and to improve your knowledge of subject related issues.
7. Work with your professor's as much as you can and form study groups if necessary, ask subject related questions, and be active.
8. Read further additional literature (Do not stick to course material completely!). The professors can always give you more literature hints.
9. Make always written notices what the instructor tells you about the subject, work through your course notes after the lectures continuously.
10. We all expect mutual respect, polite, correct, honest and sincere personal behavior on student's and instructor's side as it should be universal among human beings.
